# mysql-patch
patch for mysql with updated wolfSSL

MYSQL 8.0.0 can be found at downloads.mysql.com/archives/community/.
Select version "8.0.0" and select platform "source code". This patch was done on the Generic Linux (Architecture Independent), Compressed TAR Archive bundle. mysql-8.0.0.tar.gz

1) To run the patch, copy wolfssl-mysql-8.0.0.patch into the same directory with current MYSQL source code.
From the terminal in the same direcotry containing current MYSQL source code run
```
    patch -p1 < [directory of]/wolfssl-mysql-8.0.0.patch
```

2) Replace the mysql-8.0.0/extra/yassl directory with wolfssl. An example of replacing the directory would be "cp -r wolfssl-root mysql-8.0.0/extra/wolfssl". Remove any trace of yaSSL with "rm -rf mysql-8.0.0/extra/yassl".

3) Setup necessary wolfSSL CMake file by navigating to the directory mysql-8.0.0/extra/wolfssl/IDE/MYSQL and executing "./do.sh".

4) Next to build using updated SSL make MYSQL with the command
```
cmake . -DBUILD_CONFIG=mysql_release -DWITH_SSL=bundled (from inside the MYSQL source code directory)
```

5) Then run the standard make && sudo make install

Note: When building on Linux CFLAGS="-g1" may be needed to work around a Binutils bug. To build then it would be the command
```
CFLAGS="-g1" cmake . -DBUILD_CONFIG=mysql_release -DWITH_SSL=bundled
```
